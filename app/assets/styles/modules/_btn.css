  /* Without 'display: inline-block;', the button behaves as a block-level element:
   - It takes up the entire width of its containing block.
   - It creates line breaks before and after itself.
   - Any vertical padding or margins affect spacing above and below.
   - It does not align inline with surrounding text or elements. */
